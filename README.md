# cAIc v0.17.26

Consumer AI hardware is a wasteland of incompatibility. NVIDIA speaks CUDA, AMD speaks ROCm. Your RTX 5070 Ti lives in one machine with 16 GB VRAM; your RX 6600 XT lives in another with 12 GB. Alone, neither can run a 14B model at usable speed. Together, they could — if the software stack didn't treat heterogeneous hardware as a bug instead of a feature.

The industry consensus — llama.cpp RPC, vLLM, TensorFlow distributed — all assume a homogeneous cluster: same GPU vendor, same VRAM, same driver stack, reachable over a fast fabric. This assumption works for data centers that buy 64 identical H100s at a time. It does not work for the person who has a gaming PC with an NVIDIA card in the living room, an AMD-powered home server in the closet, and an old MacBook on the desk. That person has more aggregate compute than any single consumer machine, but no software stack can make it cooperate.

cAIc is a cluster orchestration layer that fuses mismatched GPUs, CPUs, and machines into a single inference surface. The advantage isn't just compatibility — it's matching each request to the hardware best suited for it. The coordinator (CPU-only, no discrete GPU) handles all CPU-bound work: RAG embedding, query triage, web search, memory, conversation storage, the message broker, and the web UI itself. Workers (discrete GPU) do nothing but inference — no database, no browser sessions, no orchestration overhead stealing VRAM. Triage classifies each query and routes to the node running the optimal model; if the right model isn't loaded, the coordinator requests a swap and the worker handles it asynchronously. Every machine contributes what it does best.

You might also be doing this with retired office PCs and GPUs from the Obama era. That works too. But the core problem cAIc solves isn't budget reuse — it's making non-homogeneous hardware cooperate.

### Architecture: CPU Coordinator + GPU Workers

cAIc splits the workload across two machine roles:

**Coordinator** (ultron — Ryzen 7 7840HS, no discrete GPU) runs the FastAPI app, RAG vector search (Qdrant), text embedding (Ollama on CPU), query triage (Phi-4-mini), web search (SearXNG), message broker (RabbitMQ), and all SQLite-backed services — memory, profiles, conversations, settings. Every CPU-bound task stays here.

**Workers** (jarvis — RX 6600 XT 12 GB / corsair — RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB) run only llama-server for GPU inference. The coordinator never touches a model; workers never touch the database. Workers register via AMQP, receive ping/pong health checks, and accept model-swap commands when triage determines a different model is needed for the current query.

This split keeps the UI responsive during inference (the coordinator isn't blocked by GPU compute) and lets workers focus VRAM entirely on model weights rather than browser sessions or API orchestration.

Under the hood: FastAPI + SQLite + Jinja2 on Python 3.13. Distributes inference across mismatched hardware via llama.cpp RPC with AMQP-mediated cluster coordination.

At v1.0, this ships with a Docker compose stack and setup wizard that detect CPU vs GPU, probe your hardware, and stand up SearXNG, Qdrant, RabbitMQ, and everything else with a single `docker compose up`. The same install docs work bare-metal for those who prefer to skip containers entirely.

## What's New in v0.17.26

### Dynamic Model Swap — `request_model_swap()`, `select_node()` async (Roadmap N Task 14)
- **`cluster.py`** — `request_model_swap()` publishes `cmd.swap_model` to `jc.admin`; `handle_model_ready()` and `handle_model_failed()` consume `model_ready`/`model_failed` on `jc.system`
- **`select_node()` async** — Queries worker `inventory` for ideal model; triggers swap if model not active, returns `None` for fallback during swap
- **`SUBSCRIBE_TABLE`** — 7 AMQP routing key bindings in cluster.py

### Cluster Status UI — Heartbeat + Live Status Panel (Roadmap N Task 15)
- **`handle_heartbeat()`** — Consumes `node.*.heartbeat` on `jc.system` to update `last_seen` per node
- **UI cluster panel** — sidebar polls `GET /api/cluster` every 15s; green=active, yellow=swapping, red=error/offline
- **Version bumped to v0.17.0** — All 179 tests pass

### What's New in v0.14.0

### Cluster Protocol — `GET /api/cluster`, 9 AMQP Message Types (Roadmap N Task 11)
- **`cluster.py`** — Node registry (`CLUSTER_NODES`), bounded event log (`CLUSTER_EVENTS`, max 1000), coordinator auto-promotion
- **Ping/pong health** — No passive heartbeats; coordinator pings workers on-demand before routing work. 5s timeout → auto-deregister
- **9 message types** — register, deregister, admitted, rejected, ping, pong (on `jc.admin`); event, coord_query, coord_response (on `jc.system`)
- **`amqp.py` subscribe()** — Exclusive anonymous queues bound to routing keys; `_rebind_subscriptions()` recreates them on reconnect
- **`routers/cluster.py`** — `GET /api/cluster` returns nodes, coordinator, event log

### RAG Corpus Management — `POST /api/rag/flush`, `GET /api/rag/stats` (v0.13.0)
- **Score-based eviction** with hysteresis (80% high-water, 20% low-water) and pinned sources
- **Eviction engine** in `eviction.py` — scroll Qdrant, score by retrieval count + age, evict lowest scores first
- **Grace period** — vectors younger than 1 hour are never evicted
- **Flush endpoint** — `POST /api/rag/flush` (admin) deletes all non-pinned vectors
- **Stats endpoint** — `GET /api/rag/stats` (admin) returns vector count, at-risk count, pinned count, eviction rates

### File & Document Attachments (v1.9.0–v1.10.0)
- **`POST /api/upload`** — multipart file upload with PDF/text extraction; modes: `context` (chat injection), `ingest` (RAG corpus), `both`
- **`DELETE /api/upload/{id}`** — removes upload from SQLite + Qdrant
- **`PATCH /api/upload/{id}/link`** — associates upload with a conversation
- **`GET /api/upload/by-conversation/{id}`** — list attachments per conversation
- **Paperclip UI** — file picker, preview pill, image thumbnails, gallery overlay
- **Attachment indicators** — 📎 badge on conversations with attachments
- **Chat context injection** — `upload_context_id` prepends document text to system prompt

### Terminal RAG Hook — `POST /api/ingest` (v0.11.0)
- Bearer token auth (same key as `/v1/chat/completions`)
- Chunking via shared `chunk_text()` helper, embed via Ollama, upsert to Qdrant
- `caic-ingest.sh` — PROMPT_COMMAND shell script for autonomous terminal history ingestion

### v1.8.0 Foundation (refactor & fixes)
- **Modular refactor** — single-file `app.py` split into `config.py`, `db.py`, `auth.py`, `security.py`, `memory.py`, `search.py`, `rag.py`, `gpu.py`, and `routers/` package
- **Perplexity auto-search fixed** — `logprobs: true` now properly extracted from stream chunks
- **All `/api/models` endpoints** target `LLAMA_SERVER_BASE` (llama-server) not Ollama
- **RAG embedding** via Ollama at `http://192.168.50.210:11434`
- **Origin check** applies to all API methods, rejects absent Origin/Referer

## Features

- **Persistent Memory** — SQLite FTS5 full-text search for fast, relevant memory retrieval
- **Web Search** — SearXNG integration for automatic web lookups when the model is uncertain
- **Explicit Search** — Search button to force web search without waiting for model uncertainty
- **Profile Injection** — Custom system prompt injected into every conversation
- **System Presets** — Save and switch between different system prompts
- **Real-time Stats** — CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM monitoring in sidebar
- **Token Thermometer** — Visual context window usage indicator
- **Streaming Responses** — Server-sent events for real-time token display
- **Conversation History** — SQLite-backed chat persistence with mass-delete option
- **Model Switching** — Change inference models on the fly
- **Skills Framework** — Built-in skill registry with per-skill enable/disable controls

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable caic
sudo systemctl start caic
```

## Memory Commands

In chat, natural language triggers memory operations:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| "remember that I prefer Rust over Go" | Stores as `preference` |
| "remember that cAIc runs on port 8080" | Stores as `infrastructure` |
| "note that the deadline is Friday" | Stores as `general` |
| "forget about the deadline" | Removes matching memories |

Memories are automatically searched based on your message content and injected into the system prompt when relevant.

### Memory Topics

Memories are auto-categorized:
- `preference` — likes, dislikes, choices
- `project` — active work, repos, tasks
- `infrastructure` — servers, services, configs
- `personal` — name, location, background
- `general` — everything else
